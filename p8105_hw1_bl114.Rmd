# Homework 1

### Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:

  * a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  * a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  * a character vector of length 10
  * a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dataframe_problem_1 = tibble (
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vector = random_sample >0,
  charac_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vector = factor(c("S", "M", "L", "S", "M","L","S", "M", "L", "S"))
)

dataframe_problem_1

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
